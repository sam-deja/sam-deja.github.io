## What Is PE?

PE stands for **Portable Executable**. It’s how executable code is organized on disk so that the Windows **Loader** can read it, load it into memory as a process, and start executing it.

## Why It Looks Complicated

You’ll often hear that the PE file structure is complicated—and it is. Here’s a high-level visualization from Wikipedia:

In that diagram you can see the DOS signature and stub, headers, various fields and tables, data directories, and a section table. It can feel overwhelming at first.

## The Book Analogy

Think of a PE file like a **book**:

- **Data** — the “story” written by the author (the code and data the program uses).  
- **Metadata** — information about the book and its contents (title, author, table of contents).  

PE files follow the same idea: they have **headers** (metadata) and **sections** (content).

## A Visual Reference You Can Use

Angelo (Ange) Albertini’s **Corkami** project provides an excellent visual reference of many file formats, including PE. The **PE101** poster is especially handy:

## Headers vs. Sections (In Practice)

When you open a PE from disk, it’s a stream of bytes—but it includes both **headers** and **sections**:

- **Headers** contain metadata: where things are and how they should be mapped.  
- **Sections** contain the actual content: executable code, data used by the code, resources, and more.

## Want the Deep Details?

You can find extensive, field-by-field information on the PE format in Microsoft’s documentation.

## What’s Next

Now, let’s jump into a VM and look at a real example to make these ideas concrete.
