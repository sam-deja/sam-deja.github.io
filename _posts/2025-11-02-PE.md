Inspecting a Real Windows PE File with PE Bear and dumpbin
==========================================================

This is a hands-on walkthrough for inspecting a Windows PE (Portable Executable) file using PE Bear and, if you do not have PE Bear, the Visual Studio command line tool dumpbin. Follow the steps below to open a real PE file, explore headers and sections, and understand the important parts such as text, data, and resources.


Step 1: Open the PE file in PE Bear
-----------------------------------

Start PE Bear and load a PE file from your Windows System32 folder. For this walkthrough I opened calc.exe to demonstrate common sections and metadata in a familiar Windows binary.

Once loaded, PE Bear shows an overview of the file and a detailed pane. The left side contains general information about the headers and sections, while the right side shows detailed content for the selected header or section.

Step 2: Inspect the main headers
--------------------------------

Use the right pane to inspect headers such as the optional header, which contains a lot of useful information about the binary. You will see whether the file is 32-bit or 64-bit, whether it is a GUI or console application, and the locations of important directories.

![Optional header details in PE Bear showing image base and characteristics](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/videotoblog-35c6e.appspot.com/o/%2Fusers%2F0uEQRKSAQpaO87XfrCPo2KF20Mm2%2Fblogs%2FW7gktljMlyM1KFoch2tb%2Fscreenshots%2F5ebd6f38-816d-4df8-b70d-6334bc2ed90a.webp?alt=media&token=ca537579-eb70-4ea0-82a3-af1ce6e1dbe7)

Reading the optional header helps you understand the build characteristics of the PE and the directories the loader will use at run time.

Step 3: View section headers
----------------------------

Open the Section Headers view to see the sections present in the PE. In calc.exe you will typically find several sections. For this example there are six main sections:

*   **.text** — executable code
*   **.rdata** — read-only data, such as constant strings and imported function names
*   **.data** — writable global or static variables
*   **.pdata** — exception handling and unwind information
*   **.rsrc** — resources (icons, images, manifests, even embedded PE files)
*   **.reloc** — relocation information used by the loader

Remember these three sections as the most important for many tasks: .text, .data, and .rsrc (resources). They are where code, data, and embedded assets live.

Step 4: Inspect the Resources section
-------------------------------------

The resources section is particularly interesting. It can contain multiple types of objects such as icons, images, manifest files, and even other PE files like DLLs or EXE files. This gives developers and reverse engineers options for embedding additional content inside the binary.

![Resources tab listing icons and manifest entries](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/videotoblog-35c6e.appspot.com/o/%2Fusers%2F0uEQRKSAQpaO87XfrCPo2KF20Mm2%2Fblogs%2FW7gktljMlyM1KFoch2tb%2Fscreenshots%2F231d4b53-f82a-4ebd-a440-67a9d6ee53c4.webp?alt=media&token=f16bc494-d212-4a61-9a36-854ea3bdc41c)

PE Bear allows you to expand resource entries and even view the content of manifest files directly. That makes it easy to inspect what the application declares about itself or to find embedded assets.

Embedding other PEs inside resources is a technique used in many scenarios. For defenders and analysts it is important to check resources for unexpected embedded binaries.

Step 5: Understand relocations
------------------------------

The .reloc section contains relocation entries. These entries tell the Windows loader how to adjust addresses when the module is loaded at a different base address than expected. This supports Address Space Layout Randomization and safe loading of DLLs and EXEs into memory.

![Relocations section showing relocation entries](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/videotoblog-35c6e.appspot.com/o/%2Fusers%2F0uEQRKSAQpaO87XfrCPo2KF20Mm2%2Fblogs%2FW7gktljMlyM1KFoch2tb%2Fscreenshots%2Fa8bf0c71-de00-4693-830a-1d67e6d52ae6.webp?alt=media&token=3facac93-a164-40a1-a46f-fcc7cf22fb80)

Relocations are crucial when analyzing how a binary will behave at runtime and whether the image will need fixups when loaded at an address different from its preferred base.

Step 6: Use dumpbin if you do not have PE Bear
----------------------------------------------

If you do not have PE Bear installed but you have Visual Studio, you can use the dumpbin command-line tool to inspect PE metadata.

Run:

*   dumpbin /headers path\\to\\binary.exe

![Command line showing dumpbin /headers output for a PE file](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/videotoblog-35c6e.appspot.com/o/%2Fusers%2F0uEQRKSAQpaO87XfrCPo2KF20Mm2%2Fblogs%2FW7gktljMlyM1KFoch2tb%2Fscreenshots%2F0339aa29-1570-464d-83a0-76e3936a6311.webp?alt=media&token=86df9fd3-a3e0-4bba-ad1b-f52ed859a854)

dumpbin prints the file headers, machine type (for example 64-bit), subsystem type (GUI or console), and the list of sections similar to what you saw in PE Bear. It also shows directory information such as export and import directories. For a normal executable like calc.exe you will not see an export directory, but a DLL would typically include one.

Key takeaways
-------------

*   The three most important sections to remember are .text (code), .data (writable globals), and .rsrc (resources).
*   Resources can hold images, icons, manifests, and even other PE files; always check resources for unexpected embedded content.
*   Relocations allow the loader to safely map the image into randomized memory and are stored in the .reloc section.
*   If you do not have a GUI tool like PE Bear, dumpbin /headers is a quick command-line alternative for viewing PE metadata.

> "So from this part, what I want you to remember is that there are three the most important sections for us. Okay, this is text, data and resources."

With these steps you can quickly get a solid overview of any Windows PE file and find the sections that matter most for analysis, development, or security research.
